# Nancy on Homebrew

This is a tap repo for `nancy` on Homebrew!

To install via Homebrew:

- `brew tap sonatype-nexus-community/homebrew-nancy-tap`
- `brew install nancy`

You can get more usage information for `nancy` at [the main repo](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy).

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `nancy` support in regard to this project
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using `nancy` and the [Sonatype OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/), we are glad to have you here!
